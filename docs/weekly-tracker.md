# Weekly Project Tracker — Reasoning Effort in Dynamic Environments

**Team:** Pranav Panicker · Akash Wudali · Shohini Rhea Sarkar  
**Schedule:** One task per person due Tuesday and one due Thursday; Monday is a progress discussion, **not** a task.  
**Capacity:** Plan each task for about 3–4 hours, plus a one-hour check-in and review (approximately 8–10 hours per person weekly).  
**Start:** Thursday, September 17, 2026 (launch and shared decisions). First task due Tuesday, September 22. Last planned handoff Thursday, December 10. Confirm actual course submission deadlines before relying on the final date.

## High-level direction

We will test whether an LLM agent playing [RealtimeGym's Freeway](https://github.com/SALT-NLP/RealtimeGym) should always act quickly, always reason longer, or use a small router that considers difficulty, how quickly traffic changes, and how old its current view is. Freeway asks the agent to cross changing traffic using U (up), D (down), or S (stay). The observation is the information Freeway shows the agent about the current game. We start with measured quick-versus-deliberate results, test whether changing traffic and older views alter that tradeoff, propose competing simple routing rules, and compare frozen policies on new starts. Then we validate the findings and write/present the paper.

**Terms:** One *frozen model* is one specific LLM selected in Week 1 and kept the same across policies (no training, fine-tuning, or swapping). *Quick* and *deliberate* are two recorded reasoning/output-budget settings for that model, not separate models. Tokens measure text processed/generated; seconds measure elapsed time. More thinking may help the action but costs compute and lets Freeway change. A *matched start* means compared policies face the same recorded seed/game situation. A *held-out start* is never used to change router rules. RealtimeGym offers token or wall-clock time-pressure controls; verify the actual effect of each setting rather than assuming it changes world volatility.

**Scope:** Freeway only, one frozen LLM, two selected difficulties, measured pressure settings, one fixed older-view condition, fixed quick/deliberate baselines, simple adaptive policies, and simulator-derived evaluation. Do not assume a learned volatility estimator, additional environments, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, or an LLM judge are part of the core work.

**Working rule:** Tuesday tasks must not need another Tuesday task to finish first. Thursday tasks may consume Tuesday artifacts. Keep one shared runner and a recorded configuration/seed manifest. Link each task to its GitHub Issue and submit code or docs through a reviewed PR. Each Monday meeting reviews the previous Thursday's **result and pivot decision** before new work starts. Check off a task only when its output is linked or committed; pilot figures are explicitly labeled preliminary.

## Weekly direction and tasks
### Week 1 · Sep 21–24, 2026 — Can the same LLM play Freeway quickly and deliberately?

**Thursday result:** A small quick-versus-deliberate pilot table and a labeled first figure; not yet a paper claim.

**Monday check-in (discussion, not a task):** Sep 21: Select one accessible model, agree on what quick and deliberate will mean, and assign reviewers.

**Tuesday direction:** Make the first fair Freeway comparison possible.

**Pranav — Make Freeway usable**

- [ ] Download RealtimeGym, install it, and run its supplied Freeway example.
- [ ] Save one actual game observation (the description of current player and traffic positions); identify how the example sends U (up), D (down), or S (stay), and what the game reports afterward.
- [ ] **Why:** Akash needs a verified game example before attaching an LLM. **Output:** Add tested installation commands, actions, example log, and blockers to the README.

**Akash — Choose one model and define two reasoning modes**

- [ ] Name the single LLM the team can access and afford; never commit credentials.
- [ ] Specify exactly how quick versus deliberate will differ (for example, permitted output/reasoning budget), and what stays identical; state how to record response tokens and elapsed seconds.
- [ ] **Why:** Using the same model isolates the effect of reasoning effort. **Output:** Commit a model decision note with two proposed configurations and cost/latency recording instructions.

**Rhea — Design the first pilot**

- [ ] Choose a few recorded Freeway starts and fields to log: start/seed, game setting, mode, action, game outcome, tokens, seconds.
- [ ] Write a prediction about when deliberate might help and when waiting might hurt.
- [ ] **Why:** The first runs need an explicit question. **Output:** Commit a one-page pilot plan and empty results table.

**Thursday direction:** Show the week's result and explicitly decide what it implies for next week.

**Pranav — Prove Freeway runs can be repeated**

- [ ] Repeat the supplied example on recorded settings or seeds; save several observation → action → outcome sequences.
- [ ] Check a teammate can follow the README commands.
- [ ] **Why:** One lucky run is not reproducible evidence. **Output:** Commit short logs, repeatable commands, and any README corrections.

**Akash — Run the first quick/deliberate pilot**

- [ ] After Pranav's Tuesday installation is verified, connect the selected model so it chooses U, D, or S.
- [ ] Run both reasoning settings on the same small set of starts; log actions, outcomes, tokens, seconds, and failures.
- [ ] **Why:** We need the first measurement of performance versus decision cost. **Output:** Commit runner commands, raw logs, and a side-by-side pilot table.

**Rhea — Plot and interpret the pilot**

- [ ] Plot game outcome by mode and show measured time/token use and sample sizes.
- [ ] Record failures and decide the most useful Week 2 change; label the finding preliminary.
- [ ] **Why:** Even an inconclusive pilot should steer the next experiment. **Output:** Commit one labeled figure and a next-experiment memo.


### Week 2 · Sep 28–Oct 1, 2026 — Does a faster-changing Freeway punish waiting?

**Thursday result:** A manipulation check and a pilot outcome chart across time-pressure settings.

**Tuesday direction:** Complete the inputs needed for the week's experiment.

**Pranav — Measure the effect of game speed**

- [ ] Use RealtimeGym's documented time-pressure controls at two or three settings; measure how much the game advances during equal reasoning intervals.

- [ ] **Why:** We must show that 'world speed' is actually different. **Output:** Commit tested settings, a state-change table, and the prediction.

**Akash — Automate baseline runs**

- [ ] Create commands for quick and deliberate runs that accept setting and seed.
- [ ] Automatically log action, outcome, output tokens, elapsed seconds, and failures.
- [ ] **Why:** Consistent records make experiments comparable. **Output:** Commit two run commands and example result files.

**Rhea — Define an observation-to-action change check**

- [ ] Compare actual game logs to identify what the model saw and what changed by the time its action executed.
- [ ] Write what that check measures and does not prove.
- [ ] **Why:** Long latency alone does not establish that traffic changed consequentially. **Output:** Commit a metric definition and two worked examples.

**Thursday direction:** Show the week's result and explicitly decide what it implies for next week.

**Pranav — Validate the speed manipulation**

- [ ] Repeat the change measurement at every selected setting and graph game progress.
- [ ] Document any setting that fails to create distinct traffic movement.
- [ ] **Why:** All later pressure claims depend on a real manipulation. **Output:** Commit a labeled state-change plot and run commands.

**Akash — Compare modes under pressure**

- [ ] Run quick and deliberate on matching starts at each pressure setting; keep the model and difficulty fixed.
- [ ] Record incomplete runs rather than replacing them silently.

**Rhea — Prepare matched comparison analysis**

- [ ] Write code that pairs quick and deliberate by the same start and condition.
- [ ] Define a figure of outcome difference plus token/time cost and variation across starts.
